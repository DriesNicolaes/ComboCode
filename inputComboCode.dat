RADIO_PATH=#/home/robinl/Data/Molecular/  # Path for gas radio data, leave empty if not relevant/no gas data are used other than pacs. Any requested transition that matches data in this folder will have the data plotted alongside the model! Folder requires database for data named radio_data.db

STAT_PACSMETHOD=clipping            # PEAK_STATS: (clipping or preset) The method used to determine the noise in the PACS spectrum. Clipping determines the std/rms/... on the full continuum-subtracted spectrum, then determines std/rms/... after 1-sigma clipping based on the first estimate. 'preset' takes a wavelength range from Data.dat and determines the std/rms/... for a full band, without clipping. Line scans should best be treated with 'clipping'.
STAT_CHI2_PACS=normal               # PEAK_STATS: type of chi2 calculation for integrated fluxes of PACS. [normal or log]. log just takes the log of all int fluxes and the uncertainty.

Any mline, sphinx or pacs models stemming from the same cooling id will also be deleted!!!! Now works with grids as well: Any new calculated model in the grid will NOT be deleted. (hence, if an MCMax model is the same for all models in the grid, it will not be calculated anew every single time)

APPEND_RESULTS=0                    # Append model ids of transitions in the grid to the inputfile, regardless if they've been calculated this run or not. By default this is off, since model ids are already appended if successfully calculated *this* run. This switch adds id's even if transitions are pulled from the database.
WRITE_DUST_DENSITY=0                # Write away separate density files for MCMax models (see Star.writeDensity()) --- The opacity file is now written away fully as input for GASTRoNOoM, so can be read from there.
PRINT_MODEL_INFO=0                  # Print extra model info at the end of a CC session. Is off automatically for grids > 20 models

# MOLECULAR PARAMETERS FOR WHICH WE WANT TO DO MLINE
# Sequence for input is (not formatted):
#       Molecule_name NY_LOW NY_UP N_IMPACT N_IMPACT_EXTRA ABUN_MOLEC ABUN_MOLEC_RINNER ABUN_MOLEC_RE RMAX_MOLEC ITERA USE_COLLIS_RADIAT_SWITCH R_OUTER ABUNDANCE_FILENAME ENHANCE_ABUNDANCE_FACTOR CHANGE_FRACTION_FILENAME SET_KEYWORD_CHANGE_ABUNDANCE NEW_TEMPERATURE_FILENAME SET_KEYWORD_CHANGE_TEMPERATURE
# Note that the same molecule can be passed twice, then a model grid will be created
# taking one of the two for one model, and the other for the second model
## Molecule_name = short hand molecule notation
## NY_LOW = number of levels in ground-state of molecule
## NY_UP = number of levels in first-vibrational state of molecule
## NLINE =" number of (allowed) radiative transitions in molecule 
## N_IMPACT = number of depth points in radius mesh
## N_IMPACT_EXTRA = number of depth points in radius mesh (< N_IMPACT) which specifically will be used properly sample variable mass-loss. In case of constant mass loss, take 0   
## ABUN_MOLEC = abundance at stellar radius, abun will decrease gradually toward abun_molec_rinner at r_inner
## ABUN_MOLEC_RINNER = abundance at r_inner, will decrease gradually to abun_molec_re at rmax_molec
## ABUN_MOLEC_RE =abundance at rmax_molec, abun from willacy and millar is scaled to this value between rmax_molec and r_outer
## RMAX_MOLEC = two grid points for abun between r_star and r_outer, this is the middle 
##            The above 4 parameters are not relevant for water (para+ortho), 12co and 13co: always include dummy value however!
## ITERA = Number of mline iterations, set to 0 for LTE (SiO has to have 0 here, cuz not enough collision rates available)
## LTE_REQUEST = Run mline in LTE mode
## USE_COLLIS_RADIAT_SWITCH = set to 1 if one wants to use the collision-radiative switching method of Hummer and Voels (1988)
## R_OUTER = outer radius for this molecule in R_STAR, if 0 the standard R_OUTER value is taken from the input list (which could also be "MAMON")
##          Note that for cooling the standard input values are always taken, whereas for mline/sphinx the values listed here are taken. CO should always have 0 here, or the precise fixed value from the standard input!
## ABUNDANCE_FILENAME = IF you want to include a custom abundance profile for this molecule, give the filename here. Always must have a value, but is only used if the next parameter is not zero.
##                if just filename, it is taken from ~/GASTRoNOoM/CustomAbundances, otherwise state the full path. first column radius in cm, second column abundance molecule versus H2 abundance
## ENHANCE_ABUNDANCE_FACTOR = scale the explicit abundance profile from a file with this factor. Put to 1 for no extra scaling. Put to 0 if you do not want to use a file for the abundance
##                These two parameters are ignored for isotopologues and para water, as the abundances for these are determined from the main isotopologue and the scaling factors (OPR, RATIO_12C_TO_13C, RATIO_16O_TO_17O)
## CHANGE_FRACTION_FILENAME = the filename for the filename below, only relevant if nonzero, but must be included (fraction values with which the values from
##                           cooling are multiplied to be then used in mline and sphinx; units are [cm, unitless fraction values])
## SET_KEYWORD_CHANGE_ABUNDANCE = 0 or 1: change the abundance after cooling (in samling.f and init_mline.f)
## NEW_TEMPERATURE_FILENAME = the filename for the keyword below, only relevant if nonzero, but must be included (filename with other temperature values to be used in mline and sphinx. Units are [cm,K])
## SET_KEYWORD_CHANGE_TEMPERATURE = 0 or 1: change the temperature after cooling (in sampling.f)
