Folders marked with [*] are hard-coded in ComboCode for now. Copy this from my home (/home/robinl/ComboCode) to yours.

Any folder that has [PATH_SOMETHING] next to it, can be defined explicitly in the inputfile by the give name fully in capitals. 
The path structure given here is the default, ie is the path used if you do not specify it in the inputfile. 

Inputfiles for ComboCode can be put anywhere you like. If they are in ~/ComboCode/. then you don't 
have to specify the path when you call ComboCode.py. Otherwise, always include the path.
(i.e. python ComboCode.py /home/YOUR_HOME/SOMEWHERE/SOMEWHERE_MORE_SPECIFIC/inputComboCode.dat       in the shell
or    from cc import ComboCode
      session = ComboCode.ComboCode(/home/YOUR_HOME/SOMEWHERE/SOMEWHERE_MORE_SPECIFIC/inputComboCode.dat)      in ipython) 

The folder marked by [***] is the one you get by using SVN (see the svn_usage_cc.pdf file), so do not copy that over.

      	scripts/     [*]                     IDL stuff, you don't need this, but they allow you to plot/see extra information concerning the models and comparison to ground based data

      	src/         [*]
         		data/  [*]                     molecule data files (*_indices.dat, *_radiat.dat, *_collis.dat, sphinx_indices_filename_*.dat)
                                              *.spec files (generated automatically with [UPDATE_SPEC=1])
                                              Willacy abundance profiles
                                              The indices_backup, radiat_backup and collis_backup folders
                     	
         		exec/  [*]                     cooling, mline and sphinx executables
   
      	rundir/      [PATH_GASTRONOOM] 	    This is where all the output is saved, is generated automatically, just has to be included in the inputfile
         		
   
   
   MCMax/             [*] 		               
   
      	src/         [*]		              MCMax executable (also put this thing in your /home/robinl/bin folder (or Bin?))
                     	                      Spec.out, visibilities_baseline.out
                                              inputMCMax.dat (don't change this thing unless you ask RL first)
                                              *.particle, *.opacity
                     	
      	Data/       [PATH_SED]		    SED data, but it probably makes more sense to put these in your Data/PACS folder, completely arbitrary
         		
         		Extinction_Curves/   [*]	    Contains extinction curves for extinction correction. This folder IS fixed! (is why it's a bit confusing to put the SED data here)  	
      	
      	rundir/     [PATH_MCMAX]             This is where all the output is saved, is generated automatically, just has to be included in the inputfile
      	
      	
   Data/PACS/        [PATH_PACS]              where the PACS data are taken from, default is ~/Data/PACS/,
                                              and your data should always be stored in [PATH_PACS]/[STAR_NAME]/cont_subtracted/
   
   
   LineLists/        [LL_PATH]   	          The JPL/CDMS/... linelists are stored here if you want to plot linelists on top of PACS data for instance (see CC input file)

/home/elvired/allspectra     [PATH_GAS_DATA]	 Arbitrary, is in the input file, but not really relevant for you yet until you know what's to be done with the ground-based data 
                     	                      (can use path given here from Leuven: Elvire will keep the data in this folder up-to-date on the fly)



For Vic usage:  (fill in vsc##### for YOUR_ACCOUNT, YOUR_DISK is equal to the first three digits in vsc#####)
1) login through ssh at Vic
2) mkdir COCode
3) mkdir /data/leuven/YOUR_DISK/YOUR_ACCOUNT/COCode
4) ln -s /data/leuven/YOUR_DISK/YOUR_ACCOUNT/ /user/leuven/YOUR_DISK/YOUR_ACCOUNT/dataschijf
5) scp from your local machine:
scp -r ~/GASTRoNOoM/src/data YOUR_ACCOUNT@login.vic3.cc.kuleuven.be:COCode/
scp -r ~/GASTRoNOoM/src/exec YOUR_ACCOUNT@login.vic3.cc.kuleuven.be:COCode/
6) Whenever you change the GASTRoNOoM executables (sphinx only for now), remember to copy the new version of the executables to VIC as well.

Happy modelling!
