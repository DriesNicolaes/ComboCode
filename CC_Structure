Folders marked with [*] are hard-coded in ComboCode for now. Copy these from my home (/home/robinl/) to yours.

Any folder that has [PATH_SOMETHING] next to it, can be defined explicitly in the inputfile by giving the name fully in capitals. 
The path structure given here is the default, ie is the path used if you do not specify it in the inputfile. 

Inputfiles for ComboCode can be put anywhere you like. If they are in ~/ComboCode/. then you don't 
have to specify the path when you call ComboCode.py. Otherwise, always include the path.
(i.e. python ComboCode.py /home/YOUR_HOME/SOMEWHERE/SOMEWHERE_MORE_SPECIFIC/inputComboCode.dat       in the shell
or    from cc import ComboCode
      session = ComboCode.ComboCode(/home/YOUR_HOME/SOMEWHERE/SOMEWHERE_MORE_SPECIFIC/inputComboCode.dat)      in ipython) 
I put mine in ~/ComboCode/input/ as a standard.
      
The folder marked by [***] is the one you get by using SVN (see the svn_usage_cc.pdf file), so do not copy that over.


/home/YOUR_HOME/
   
   ComboCode/        [*]              	     __init__.py is located here. Copy this.
                     	                      
      	Data/        [*]    	             Dust.dat, Molecule.dat, Star.dat, Indices.dat, Sed.Dat, Data.dat, Pacs_Resolution* files. Copy these.
                                              
         cc/         [***]                   Input_Keywords_cooling.dat, Input_Keywords_mline.dat, Input_Keywords_sphinx.dat
                                             Mutable_Parameters_GASTRoNOoM.dat, Mutable_Parameters_MCMax.dat
                                             All .py files and modules, this file (CC_Structure)
                                             inputComboCode.dat (sample inputfile, copy this elsewhere and modify for your own purposes)
   
   
   GASTRoNOoM/        [*]                    inputGASTRoNOoM.dat
                     	                     vic_run_jobs_example.sh
                                             vic_job_example.sh
                                             ==> Copy over, never change these

      	src/         [*]
         		data/  [*]           molecule data files (*_indices.dat, *_radiat.dat, *_collis.dat, sphinx_indices_filename_*.dat)
                                             *.spec files (generated automatically with [UPDATE_SPEC=1])
                                             Willacy abundance profiles
                                             The indices_backup, radiat_backup and collis_backup folders
                     	
         		exec/  [*]           cooling, mline and sphinx executables. Note that this has two folders. 
   
      	rundir/      [PATH_GASTRONOOM] 	     This is where all the output is saved, is generated automatically, just has to be included in the inputfile for ComboCode. 
         		
   
   
   MCMax/             [*] 		     inputMCMax.dat : Copy over to the same location. Important for ComboCode to make proper MCMax input files!
   
      	src_nov2013/    [*]	             MCMax executable (also put this thing in your /home/robinl/bin folder (or Bin?))
                     	                     Spec.out, visibilities_baseline.out     
                                             *.particle, *.opacity
  		
  	Extinction_Curves/   [*]	     Contains extinction curves for extinction correction. This folder IS fixed! 
      	
      	rundir/     [PATH_MCMAX]             This is where all the output is saved, is generated automatically, just has to be included in the inputfile
      	
      	
   Data/PACS/        [PATH_PACS]              where the PACS data are taken from, default is ~/Data/PACS/,
                                              and your data should always be stored in [PATH_PACS]/[STAR_NAME]/cont_subtracted/
   
   
   LineLists/        [LL_PATH]               The JPL/CDMS/... linelists are stored here if you want to plot linelists on top of PACS data for instance (see CC input file)

/home/robinl/Data/Molecular/  [PATH_GAS_DATA]	 Arbitrary, is in the input file, but not really relevant for you yet until you know what's to be done with the ground-based data 
                     	                       

For Vic usage:  (fill in vsc##### for YOUR_ACCOUNT, YOUR_DISK is equal to the first three digits in vsc#####)
1) login through ssh at Vic
2) mkdir COCode
3) mkdir /data/leuven/YOUR_DISK/YOUR_ACCOUNT/COCode
4) ln -s /data/leuven/YOUR_DISK/YOUR_ACCOUNT/ /user/leuven/YOUR_DISK/YOUR_ACCOUNT/dataschijf
5) scp from your local machine:
scp -r ~/GASTRoNOoM/src/data YOUR_ACCOUNT@login.vic3.cc.kuleuven.be:COCode/
scp -r ~/GASTRoNOoM/src/exec YOUR_ACCOUNT@login.vic3.cc.kuleuven.be:COCode/
6) Whenever you change the GASTRoNOoM executables (sphinx only for now), remember to copy the new version of the executables to VIC as well.

Happy modelling!
