###Input Syntax:
### no value		 									: CC tries to calculate the value itself and updates the value through the 
###														  iteration
### % 													: As if there was no value given, dummy for including a 'normal' model in 
###														  a grid, only works for semicolons and NOT-MANDATORY input (see info file)
### 1 value  											: unchanged throughout the modeling
### 2-5 values separated by COMMAs  			: grid [min,max,number gridpoints including boundaries OPTIONAL
###														  (default 2), 1 for logspace/0 for no logspace OPTIONAL (default 0)], 
###														  1 for int/0 for float OPTIONAL (default 1),
###														  Any information cannot be omitted if it occurs before the last included
###														  option in the list; e.g. if int option is explicitly stated all
###														  other information has to be given as well!
### 2 or more values separated by SEMICOLONS : explicit grid declaration
### 2 or more values separated by COLONS     : Explicit declaration of model parameters; no grid! The first parameter 
###                                            in every such defined parameter belongs to the first model, the second
###                                            belongs to the second model, and so on.
###                                            All such declared parameters must have the same amount of values.
### 2 or more values separated by AMPERSANDS	: multiple values relevant for 1 model/star (such as multiple molecules)
### 2 or more (even) values (value*integer&value*integer&...) : multiple values relevant, with certain multiplicity (name value first, THEN the count),
### 2 or more (even) values (value*integer;value*integer;...)   can be used with &, with : and with ; but never mix the two! 
### 2 or more (even) values (value*integer:value*integer:...)   if used, always include the delimiter chosen, if it is 
###																normally not present, end the line with it

###OTHER PARAMETERS
###		-- These are included in the code, but if a new star is used or wrong value in code, it can be changed here
###		-- Are taken from a list based on the SIMBAD name of the star.
###		-- Contact Robin to add the new star and/or values
###		-- Some values are calculated automatically after iteration or from basic data set. They can be overridden by

OPTIONAL IMMUTABLE INPUT
	- CAN be explicitly stated and is NEVER changed during model. 
	- Includes:
		* PATH_GAS_DATA:				Where to find the transition data, default=~/GASTRoNOoM/Data, any entries starting 
											with '_' will be ignored when looking for data
		* PATH_DUST_DATA: 			Where to find the transition data, default=~/MCMax/Data, 'Data' must be

											file doesn't change throughout modeling
		* DENSTYPE: 					Density structure datatype: "'MASSLOSS'", "'FILE'", if included it is fixed throughout
											modeling, if not included it tries the "'FILE'" type by checking if a viable GASTRoNOoM
											model is present. If "'FILE'", also include DENSFILE keyword, which also doesn't change
											If DENSFILE is not included, a keyword for LAST_GASTRONOOM_MODEL HAS to be present,
											or an error will occur.

		* R_INNER:						Inner radius of the CSE at the dust formation region, is calculated from last MCMax 
											model, or is taken to be 1 R_STAR if this model is not yet calculated, but can be 
											explicitly stated as well, in case there is a 'hole' in the inner CSE [R_STAR]

											DUST input and should not be given here unless really necessary
		* T_INNER_DUST:				Dust temperature at inner radius, is normally taken to be the highest dust condensation
											temperature of the dust species that are present [K]

											temperature, which is determined automatically, but can always be stated explicitly. 
		* T_MIN_SPECIES:				Minimum required temperature for some dust species [K]
		* V_LSR:							Stellar velocity with respect to the Local Standard of Rest (standard list 
											included in code) [km/s]
		* V_EXP_DUST:					Dust terminal velocity, is calculated from drift and gas terminal velocity [km/s]

Folders marked with [*] are hard-coded in ComboCode for now. Copy these from my home (/home/robinl/) to yours.

Any folder that has [PATH_SOMETHING] next to it, can be defined explicitly in the inputfile by giving the name fully in capitals. 
The path structure given here is the default, ie is the path used if you do not specify it in the inputfile. 

Inputfiles for ComboCode can be put anywhere you like. If they are in ~/ComboCode/. then you don't 
have to specify the path when you call ComboCode.py. Otherwise, always include the path.
(i.e. python ComboCode.py /home/YOUR_HOME/SOMEWHERE/SOMEWHERE_MORE_SPECIFIC/inputComboCode.dat       in the shell
or    from cc import ComboCode
      session = ComboCode.ComboCode(/home/YOUR_HOME/SOMEWHERE/SOMEWHERE_MORE_SPECIFIC/inputComboCode.dat)      in ipython) 
I put mine in ~/ComboCode/input/
      
The folder marked by [***] is the one you get by using SVN (see the svn_usage_cc.pdf file), so do not copy that over.
